 ## Design 

 ### Fonts
  - The font utilized for headers is 'Oswald'.
  - The font used for the rest of the body text is 'Chakra Petch'.
  - "Sans Serif is designated as a backup font in case the chosen font fails to load correctly."


 ### Color Scheme 
  - Idea of making a gradient background was influenced from [Hostinger tutorials](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/website-color-schemes#:~:text=Blue%20Shades%20and%20White,white%20gradient%20as%20the%20background.)
  - The color theme of the website was influenced by the Hero image and the Favicon. The base background color is #4024df.
  - Color of text varies between black (#1f1f1f) when there is a light background and white (#d5d5d5) when there is a darker background.
  - The background colors of buttons consist of various shades of purple, transitioning to a lighter shade when hovered over.
